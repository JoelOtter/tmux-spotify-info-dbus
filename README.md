# tmux-spotify-info

This is an alternative version of [tmux-spotify-info](https://github.com/jdxcode/tmux-spotify-info)
which uses DBus (suitable for Linux systems) rather than Applescript.

It uses some stuff from [sp](https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547), which
is a more comprehensive DBus interface you should check out.
